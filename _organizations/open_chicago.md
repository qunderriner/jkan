title: Chicago Data Portal 
description: The City of Chicago's open data portal lets you find city data, lets you find facts about your neighborhood, lets you create maps and graphs about the city, and lets you freely download the data for your own analysis. Many of these datasets are updated at least once a day, and many of them are updated several times a day. The open data portal is required under an Executive Order signed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel on December 10, 2012.
